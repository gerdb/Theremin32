### A very cheap and easy to build Theremin for only 30..50$

* Only an STM32 evaluation board, 2 oscillators and some knobs and switches needed.
* Excellent audio quality: 16/24bit audio DAC with headphone amplifier
* Can load waveforms with Theremin sound directly from an USB stick
* Very fast autotune: 1sec

# Hardware
The STM32F407G-DISC1 evaluation board can be used.
So you need only 2 additional oscillators and some pots.

L1 should be an air-coil with 1mH. Eg. 200 windings of 0.15mm wire on a core with 40mm diameter.

## Breadboard
The oscillators can be build up with SMD components on a breadboard.
So no extra PCB is necessary:

| ANALOG_5   | PC5      | P1        | Analog input from waveform potentiometer       |



## Auto-tune
The blue button on the STM32 discovery board starts the Auto-Tune procedure.

![auto tune button](pics/auto_tune.png "auto tune")

You can also use an additional button and connect it to:

| Name       | PIN Name | Connector | Description                   |
| ---------- | -------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| VDD        | VDD      | P1        | 3V supply auto-tune button    |
| Auto-tune  | PA0      | P1        | Signal from auto-tune button  |

## Pitch LED display
Optional display to show the current played note one a piano like display.

![LED display](pics/led_display.png "LED display")

Connect 3mm LEDs with a series resistor of 100R to these PINs and connect all
cathodes of to GND:

| Name         | PIN Name | Connector | Description                                    |

| PITCH LED 11 | PD11     | P1        | Note h                   |


## USB-stick with sound file
It's possible to store a \*.WAV or a \*.C file on an USB-stick and use it as sound source for the theremin.
#### WAV file
The file name must be **WAV1.WAV** and it must contain 1 periode of a sound sample. File format must be WAV (Microsoft) and the data format signed 16 bit PCM with only one mono track. Use Audacity to export it. https://www.audacityteam.org/ 
#### C file
The file name must be **WAV1.C** and it must contain 1 periode of a sound sample. File format must be the same as the Audio Wavetables from the Open.Theremin V3 project. http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenTheremin/index.php/download/audio-wavetables 


## Programming software for STM32
Program the STM32 board with the [STM32CUBEPROG](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stm32cubeprog.html) tool.

## Case and front panel
As case a wooden wine box could be used.

![Wooden wine box](pics/wine_box.jpg "Wooden wine box")

The cheapest way for a professional looking front panel would be to use the service of a sign manufacturer. For example:
https://www.digitaldruck-fabrik.de/werbeschilder/hart-pvc-polystyrolplatte.aspx

Price of a 380x110mm front panel is about 4â‚¬ or 5$

You can use the template under hardware/Frontpanel, but you have to adapt the size of the front panel file to your wine box. Use eg. https://inkscape.org
